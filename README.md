# Simple-Darker-Theme-PE

A simple darker theme for Pyoncord/Bunny

âš« This is not an Amoled theme, it's a fairly dark theme designed to stay close to the base application without major modifications

- **It's simply darker**

ðŸŸ£ I created another variant with a touch of purple for those who want something more colorful
 
Other colorful variants will likely come later (Soonâ„¢)

**Download:**

   - [SDT Purple Touch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Purple-EyeZ/Simple-Darker-Theme-PE/main/Purple_Touch.json)


The colorful version is not exactly as I wanted due to Discord's limitations (improvements might be made later if I find solutions)

(It's just a test for now)
